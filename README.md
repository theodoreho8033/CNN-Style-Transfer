A Style Transfer deep learning algorithm to augment real-life portraits to paintings

Style Transfer a machine learning problem where the "style" of one image is mixed into the "content" of another. In this project, I mixed the style of paintings with the content of photorealistic portraits to generate painting portraits. In a sense, this really is just a fancy Image filter like the ones you see on SnapChat. This is particularly interesting because it demonstrates that we can actually somewhat understand complex latent spaces to the extent that we can manipulate the latent features in an informed and directed process through supervsied training. .
