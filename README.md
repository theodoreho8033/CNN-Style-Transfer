# CNN-Style-Transfer

A Style Transfer deep learning algorithm to augment real-life portraits to paintings

Extracted style encodings from a pre-trained image classifier (VGG-19). Matched style encodings of content image (portrait) to the style of a painting. Experimented with matching style encodings to a distribution of paintings rather than the conventional method of just using one painting.
